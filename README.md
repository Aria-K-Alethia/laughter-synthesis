# Laughter synthesis using Pseudo Phonetic Tokens
Official implementation of the paper "Laughter Synthesis using Pseudo Phonetic Tokens with a Large-scale In-the-wild Laughter Corpus" accepted by *INTERSPEECH 2023*.

>**Abstract:**<br>
We present a large-scale in-the-wild Japanese laughter corpus and a laughter synthesis method.
Previous work on laughter synthesis lacks not only data but also proper ways to represent laughter.
To solve these problems, we first propose an in-the-wild corpus comprising $3.5$ hours of laughter, which is to our best knowledge the largest laughter corpus designed for laughter synthesis.
We then propose pseudo phonetic tokens (PPTs) to represent laughter by a sequence of discrete tokens, which are obtained by training a clustering model on features extracted from laughter by a pretrained self-supervised model.
Laughter can then be synthesized by feeding PPTs into a text-to-speech system.
We further show PPTs can be used to train a language model for unconditional laughter generation.
Results of comprehensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a baseline method, and can generate natural laughter unconditionally.
